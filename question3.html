<!-- when we run this .html file first it will print the all content in HTML file. The script.js file will be invoked. this goes to script.js file and print
line by line. 
In script.js, the first line is alert() it alert window will be opened in your brower. when you take action
on alert window then it will go to next line. 
And second also has alert function without semicolon. It wont through error
because JS engine assign semicolon by own. once we take action on alert window it will go to third line.
Here third line also has alert function which is used to print string. In this alert we did not use double quotes.
we used template literals instead of double quote which will output same like in which format we gave as input
once done it will go to fourth line. fourth line is just normal addition -->
